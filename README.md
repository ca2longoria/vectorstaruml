vectorstaruml
=============

Convert StarUML's diagram uml file to an svg vector image file.


#### Notes
* I'm still mostly messing around until I think through a proper model for all this.  Somewhere, I'll put a disclaimer or something stating no personal involvement with the wondrous work that is [StarUML](http://sourceforge.net/projects/staruml/).  All I'm doing here is translating their default-save XML file into a similarly-appearing SVG.
